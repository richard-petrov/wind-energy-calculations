# Wind Energy Calculations

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on the analysis, design, and performance evaluation of wind turbines and wind farms. It is intended for students, engineers, and researchers interested in wind energy systems.

## üå¨Ô∏è Overview

The notebooks are grouped into thematic folders covering different aspects of wind energy:

- **blade_testing_and_modelling/**  
  Modeling and structural analysis of wind turbine blades. Includes aerodynamic calculations and material stress analysis.

- **composite_materials/**  
  Investigation of mechanical properties and fatigue performance of composite materials used in blades.

- **fatigue_prediction/**  
  Prediction of component fatigue based on load cycles and stress analysis.

- **measure_wind/**  
  Techniques for analyzing wind measurement data, including speed, direction, and turbulence.

- **wind_energy_economics/**  
  Economic analysis tools for wind energy projects, including LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) and return on investment.

- **wind_farm_design/**  
  Tools and models for optimizing the layout and power output of wind farms.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/richard-petrov/wind-energy-calculations.git
